    <h3>Curses, Clashes, and Closing Chapters: JJK’s Manga Storm Unfolds</h3>
    <p>
      The spin-off series Jujutsu Kaisen: Modulo has officially entered its final arc, with Manga Plus confirming that the climactic battles—Yuka vs. Dabura and Tsurugi vs. Maru—will conclude the story within the next 9–10 chapters. Meanwhile, the main Jujutsu Kaisen manga has surpassed 150 million copies in circulation, overtaking Attack on Titan and now aiming to surpass Demon Slayer in global sales.
      The Modulo spin-off, which debuted in September 2025, has quickly become a fan favorite thanks to its fresh cast, expanded world-building, and shocking reveals—such as the introduction of sorcerers powerful enough to rival or even surpass Gojo Satoru. Creator Gege Akutami confirmed that Modulo was always intended as a short-run series, lasting only six months, and readers are now witnessing its intense finale as war breaks out between humans and the mysterious Simurians. On the main series side, Jump Festa 2026 brought huge announcements: Jujutsu Kaisen’s anime will continue with the Culling Game arc, and the manga’s momentum shows no signs of slowing down.
      In short, fans are experiencing a double wave of excitement—the Modulo spin-off racing toward its conclusion while the main series cements its place among the top-selling manga of all time.

    <h3>Author’s Interview</h3>
    <p>
      At a special Jujutsu Kaisen exhibition in Japan, Akutami admitted that while he’s proud of the manga’s success, he sometimes wishes he had structured certain story arcs differently. He reflected on the emotional weight of Gojo’s battle with Sukuna, explaining that Gojo’s loss wasn’t simply about strength but narrative necessity, and he acknowledged fan reactions—both excitement and disappointment—as part of the journey. Akutami also revealed that Fate/stay night and Fate/Zero heavily influenced his storytelling style, shaping JJK’s complex world-building and character dynamics.

    <h3>JJK Execution Movie Success</h3>
    <p>
      Jujutsu Kaisen: Execution proved to be a solid box office success, grossing between $43–48 million worldwide by late 2025, with Japan leading its earnings and the U.S. contributing around $15 million after a strong $10 million opening weekend. Despite being shorter than typical anime films at just 87 minutes, its polished animation and emotional stakes drew fans back for repeat viewings, helping sustain momentum across Europe and Asia. While its total fell short of Jujutsu Kaisen 0, the film still reinforced the franchise’s global popularity, serving as both a dramatic conclusion to the Shibuya Incident and a prologue to the Culling Game, ensuring anticipation for Season 3 remained high.
    </p>
    <h3>Sequel Rumors</h3>
    <p>
      Following the release of Jujutsu Kaisen: Execution, rumors of a sequel quickly began circulating among fans and anime news outlets, fueled by the film’s cliffhanger ending and its role as a bridge into the Culling Game arc. Speculation suggests that the next theatrical installment could adapt the early stages of the Culling Game, focusing on Yuji Itadori’s survival against execution orders and Yuta Okkotsu’s shifting loyalties. Industry insiders have hinted that the strong box office performance of Execution makes a follow-up highly likely, though no official confirmation has been given by MAPPA or TOHO. Fans are particularly excited by the possibility of seeing high-stakes battles like Hakari’s domain expansion or Kinji’s introduction on the big screen, making the sequel rumors a hot topic across anime forums and social media.
