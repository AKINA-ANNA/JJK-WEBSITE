          <h3>
            The Jujutsu Kaisen franchise continues to dominate the shonen scene even after the manga’s ending. Akutami surprised fans by returning with Jujutsu Kaisen: Modulo, a short but intense sequel that pits humanity against the Simurians, with Chapter 18 set to release on January 18, 2026. Meanwhile, the anime is keeping momentum alive: Season 3 kicks off with a double-episode premiere, adapting the Culling Game arc where Yuji Itadori and his allies face a deadly battle royale. Beyond story developments, the series has hit a milestone of 150 million copies in circulation, cementing its place among the most successful modern manga. With Akutami also working on a new project titled Mojuro, fans can expect the JJK universe to keep expanding even as the original saga closes.

          <h1>Author’s Interview</h1>
          <h3>
            In a 2024 reflection, Akutami admitted feeling “fed up” at times with the demanding pace of weekly manga creation, sharing how self-doubt and raw self-criticism shaped his process. He also revealed regrets about certain story decisions, acknowledging that fan reactions made him wish he had handled some arcs differently. At a 2025 exhibition, Akutami explained the controversial battle between Gojo and Sukuna, clarifying that Gojo’s loss wasn’t due to weakness but rather narrative necessity. These interviews gave fans a rare, intimate look into his mindset—balancing creative pride with vulnerability—and highlighted how deeply he considers both character arcs and reader expectations.

          <h1>JJK Execution Movie Success</h1>
          <h3>
            The Jujutsu Kaisen “execution” storyline is often discussed in news and fan circles because it represents a turning point in how the series explores themes of justice, responsibility, and the weight of decisions made by higher authorities. Instead of focusing on battles or plot twists, the arc highlights the tension between individual will and institutional power, showing how characters must navigate rules that may feel unfair or harsh. It’s remembered as one of the moments where the manga shifts tone, emphasizing moral dilemmas and the emotional impact of being judged by others rather than just physical conflict.


          </h3>
          <h1>Sequel Rumors</h1>
          <h3>
           After the “Execution” storyline, Jujutsu Kaisen has sparked talk of movie sequels that would expand on the fallout and bridge into the Culling Game arc, with fans speculating about a direct continuation film following the compilation movie Jujutsu Kaisen: Execution (released in late 2025). Industry chatter suggests that future films may adapt key battles from the Culling Game in cinematic form, rather than waiting for full anime seasons, giving audiences a high‑impact theatrical experience. While no official confirmation has been made, the success of earlier JJK films (Jujutsu Kaisen 0 and Execution) makes sequels highly likely, and rumors point to production teams exploring ways to balance anime season pacing with standalone movie releases to keep momentum strong.
